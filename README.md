This project demonstrates the use of K-Means clustering to segment customers based on specific features. The segmentation allows businesses to identify distinct groups of customers for targeted marketing, personalized offers, and improved customer satisfaction.

Features:
> Data Analysis and Visualization: Understand customer data using exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualize patterns using charts.
> K-Means Clustering: Apply K-Means clustering algorithm to segment customers into distinct groups.
> Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values and standardize data for better clustering results.
> Interactive Visualizations: Gain insights into clusters through plots and charts.

Libraries Used:
The following Python libraries are used in this project:

1. NumPy: For numerical computations.
2. Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
3. Matplotlib: For creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations.
4. Seaborn: For enhanced visualization styles and ease of plotting.
5. scikit-learn (sklearn): For implementing the K-Means clustering algorithm.

Dataset: (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python)
The dataset used for this project contains customer data with features such as:
  > Annual Income
  > Spending Score

Project Workflow:
  1 Import Libraries: Import the required Python libraries.
  2 Load Dataset: Load the dataset using pandas.
  3 Exploratory Data Analysis:
    > Inspect dataset statistics.
    > Visualize relationships using seaborn and matplotlib.
  4 Data Preprocessing:
    > Handle missing or inconsistent data.
    > Standardize features for better clustering.
  5 Apply K-Means Clustering:
    > Determine the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow Method.
    > Perform clustering on the preprocessed data.
  6 Visualize Clusters:
    > Use scatter plots and other visualizations to analyze and interpret the clusters.
  7 Conclusions:
    > Provide insights and recommendations based on cluster characteristics

Results:
The project segments customers into distinct groups based on their attributes. For example:
  > High-income, high-spending customers.
  > Low-income, low-spending customers.

Insights from these segments can be used to drive marketing and operational strategies.
